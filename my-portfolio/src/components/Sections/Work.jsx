                AllerGenius is probably the project I&apos;m most proud of, even
                though the design is really simple. The entire process, from the
                creation of the idea to the last line of code, was carried out
                by me and another friend. It is an application that scans
                barcodes and, depending on the user&apos;s allergies, indicates
                whether the product is safe for consumption. The backend was
                made with a REST API made by us and the frontend was made using
                React Native. For more details visit the project's page.

                InnerPeace is an innovative platform designed to promote mental
                well-being and habit improvement. Developed in collaboration
                with a friend, this application helps users focus on their
                personal goals by providing specific activities to support them
                along the way. Additionally, it features tools to track
                progress, such as a journal for monitoring thought evolution,
                and a community section that fosters interaction among members.
                Built with Vue on the frontend and a REST API with MySQL on the
                backend, InnerPeace combines efficient technology with a
                meaningful purpose.
